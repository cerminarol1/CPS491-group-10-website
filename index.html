                    <img  src="images/RiversideResearchLogo.jpg">
                    <p>Riverside Research is a nonprofit organization that has been completing cutting edge 
                        research since it was established in 1967. Their research covers many fields which 
                        include radar, intelligence & surveillance, THz Imaging, and of course, Artificial 
                        Intelligence & Machine Learning. </p>
        <hr>
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>There are many different LLMs available, and all have varying degrees of competency in 
                    different fields. In order to maximize accuracy and efficiency, as well as minimize waste 
                    and cost, Riverside Research wants a way to choose the best LLM based on their various 
                    coding proficiencies. This will allow for programmers to have one convenient tool that 
                    will effectively act as the best LLM for each question, to make development in other projects faster.
                </p>
                <h3> Project Vision </h3>
                    <p>To research and develop an effective routing tool for utilizing the strengths of
                    multiple LLM models related to various software development processes and programming
                    categories.</p>
                <h3> Project Goals</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Comprise and present research on various LLM models regarding their effectiveness in
                            software development. </li>
                        <li> Develop a functional web application that utilizes the varying strengths of multiple LLM
                            models in software development. </li>
                    </ol>

            <h2> Sprint 1</h2>
                <h3>Sprint Goals</h3>
                    <p>Goals for this sprint surrounded mainly around completing reasearch in preperation for 
                    development. The major objectives were performing initial research on possible LLMs to use, as well as 
                    establishing and familiarizing ourselves with the technologies that would be used. </p>
                <h3>Development Progress</h3>
                    <p>In this sprint we successfully determined and familiarized outsevles with the relevant 
                        technologies for this project's tech stack. Some preliminary prototype applications were
                        developed as we learned Vue and FastAPI. Cursory research was conducted into viable LLMs, 
                        including Llama, Mistral, Granite, and CodeGen. </p>
                    <p>We also began some preliminary design work. Pictured below is a basic diagram detailing 
                        the user input and system output.</p>

            <h2>Sprint 2 </h2>
            <h3>Sprint Goals</h3>
                <p>The goals for this sprint were concentrated around two main deliverables. These deliverables were a research paper 
                    that detailed categories for routing questions as well as the best LLMs for each category, and a working prototype 
                    that can demonstrate basic functionality. </p>
            <h3> Development Progress</h3>
                <p>In this sprint we engaged in a research project to determine the categories for routing questions 
                    to LLMs and determined the best LLMs for handling questions from each category. Our research consisted 
                    of consulting scholarly sources and developer resources for LLMs that fit within the acceptable criteria 
                    for the project, developing categories that adequately cover many programming problems that developers 
                    could face, finding benchmarks that uses accurate metrics to evaluate and LLM’s capabilities in a category, 
                    and evaluating each LLM’s aptitude for each category. The categories we decided on were Code Translation, 
                    Code Completion, Code Generation, Code Repair, Code Interpretation, Data Science, and Syntax Errors. We 
                    settled on three LLMs to use in the development cycle, each with their own distinct advantages in one or 
                    many categories. These LLMs are Llama3, Granite 3.0, and Codestral Mamba. Llama3 was found to handle 
                    questions on Code Translation, Code Completion, Code Generation, Code Repair, and Code Interpretation most 
                    effectively. Granite 3.0 was chosen to handle Data Science questions. Codestral Mamba was found to be most 
                    effective for Syntax Error questions.</p>
                <p>Below is a link to the completed research report, which includes further justification of our findings.</p>

                <p>Alongside the research report, we also began development on the routing system. In this development cycle, 
                    we developed a basic prototype of the application. It takes input from the user in the form of a question 
                    and a category and sends it to an LLM integrated into the application, currently Llama3.</p>

            <h2> Sprint 3</h2>
            <h3>Sprint Goals</h3>
                <p>The goals for this sprint were to finalize the development of the back end and to create a fully functional front end for our product.</p>
            <h3>Development Progress</h3>
                <p>In this sprint we finalized the features of the back end and developed a user interface to complete the 
                    development cycle of our product. Alongside the already established categories, we inculded and automatic 
                    categorization feature that users can select. This selection will prompt an LLM to categorize the question 
                    itself, and then route it to the proper LLM to answer the question. We also implemented a changeable chat 
                    history, which allows the user to decide which already exisiting messages the LLM should take into account 
                    when answering a question. Users can now toggle the visibility of those messages to the LLM, as well as 
                    remove them permanently from the chat history. We also developed a fully functional user interface in Vue 
                    that serves as our front end for the product. Features included to ensure an easy user experience includes 
                    an adjustable input box, a scrollable output box which can toggle individual message history, a hoverable 
                    tutorial blurb that gives the user instructions on how to use the application, a dropdown menu with the 
                    question categories, and a loading symbol so that users know their question is being processed. 
                </p>
                <p>Below is a recorded demo of the final fully functional product as of completion of Sprint 3. </p>
